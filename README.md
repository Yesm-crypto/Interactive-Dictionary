# Interactive-Dictionary
An interactive dictionary, with walkthrough for begineers.
I had just completed the python basics, when i did this project.
I had included my walkthrough here, which can be very useful for a pythoneer.
So, i encourage you to learn from my mistakes and findings.

Findings:
> Database management with mysql.connector and sqlite3
> Json library
> csv
> Workflow of Application Development
